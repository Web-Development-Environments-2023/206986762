    <div class="cleaner h10"></div>
    <div class="sol">
      <p1>Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 are different stages of the evolution of the World Wide Web. Here are three key
        differences between these three stages:</p1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            User Experience: Web 1.0 was a static web, where users could only read and browse the content. In Web 2.0,
            users were able to participate and interact with the content, such as commenting, sharing, and contributing.
            Web 3.0 is focused on a more personalized and immersive experience, utilizing technologies such as virtual
            reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain to provide more customized and decentralized content and
            services.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Technology: Web 1.0 was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web 2.0 added AJAX, APIs, and social media
            platforms. Web 3.0 utilizes a range of emerging technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence,
            machine learning, and the semantic web to create a more intelligent, decentralized and secure web.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Data Ownership: Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 have centralized models, where data is owned and controlled by a few
            dominant players such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Web 3.0 aims to create a more decentralized web,
            where users have greater ownership and control over their data, and can interact with services and content
            in a more peer-to-peer manner. Blockchain technology plays a key role in this, enabling secure and
            transparent data storage and exchange.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    
    <p1>Here are three use case examples for each of the three stages of web evolution:</p1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Web 1.0:

          a. Online directories and catalogues: Examples of Web 1.0 use cases include websites that served as online
          directories and catalogues, such as Yahoo! and the early versions of Amazon. These websites primarily provided
          static information that users could browse but did not allow much user interaction.

          b. News websites: Another example of a Web 1.0 use case is news websites, which provided static news articles
          and updates that users could read but did not allow for much user interaction.

          c. Brochure websites: Many early websites were simply online versions of printed brochures, with information
          about the company, its products or services, and how to contact them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Web 2.0:

          a. Social media platforms: One of the most popular use cases of Web 2.0 is social media platforms such as
          Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, where users can create and share content, interact with each other, and
          build communities.

          b. User-generated content platforms: Another use case for Web 2.0 is user-generated content platforms such as
          Wikipedia and YouTube, where users can create, edit and share their own content.

          c. Collaborative tools: Collaborative tools such as Google Docs, Trello, and Slack are also examples of Web
          2.0 use cases. These tools allow users to collaborate in real-time and work together on projects, irrespective
          of their physical location.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Web 3.0:

          a. Decentralized finance (DeFi): One of the most prominent use cases of Web 3.0 is decentralized finance
          (DeFi), which is based on blockchain technology. DeFi allows for the creation of decentralized financial
          instruments and applications that can operate without the need for intermediaries or centralized authorities.

          b. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR): Another use case for Web 3.0 is virtual and augmented
          reality. These technologies can create more immersive and personalized experiences for users, such as virtual
          meetings, product demonstrations, and training programs.

          c. Decentralized marketplaces: Decentralized marketplaces such as OpenSea, Rarible, and NFT marketplace
          provide a platform for buying and selling digital assets such as art, music, and other collectibles on the
          blockchain, without the need for intermediaries or centralized authorities.
